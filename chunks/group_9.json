Techniques for name service resolution poisoning can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.</p><p>Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.</p><p>Adversaries may also try to collect vehicle telemetry, including propulsion system status (e.g., hard acceleration or braking), whether vehicle enclosures are locked / unlocked, etc.</p><p>This technique's description was adapted from <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a>.</p>",
