For example, we send a UDP as follow to open the trunk.\u201c\n\nThey also found that arbitrary CAN messages can be sent to any CAN bus on the vehicle network by misusing a diagnostic function: \u201cWe can send any CAN message to any CAN bus channel in the car, thanks to the Gateway leaving an obvious way in diagtask which can be used to inject CAN bus (diagnosis function 0x04) by sending UDP messages to 3500 port on the Gateway\u201c\n\nSome messages were selectively blocked to disable safety interlocks: \u201cwe can block some important messages (like the ID of 0x218 on BDY CAN) by changing the target ID in firmware after we locating the structure stored in the firmware to open the trunk or disable the auto lock function when car is in very high speed.

All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.</p><p>Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell aside\" data-type=\"aside\">\n",

Techniques for name service resolution poisoning can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.</p><p>Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.</p><p>Adversaries may also try to collect vehicle telemetry, including propulsion system status (e.g., hard acceleration or braking), whether vehicle enclosures are locked / unlocked, etc.</p><p>This technique's description was adapted from <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a>.</p>",
