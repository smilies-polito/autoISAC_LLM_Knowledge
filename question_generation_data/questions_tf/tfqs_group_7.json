            "T": "True, a rogue cellular base station can be used to maintain remote access.",

        "Explanation": {
            "T": "The use of a rogue cellular base station can indeed allow adversaries to eavesdrop on or manipulate communications, which can be used to maintain remote access.",
            "F": "While a rogue cellular base station is used to eavesdrop or manipulate communications, it can also maintain remote access to the vehicle."

            "T": "Physical modification techniques require direct physical access to the vehicle’s components and cannot be achieved solely via radio interfaces.",

            "T": "Bluetooth vulnerabilities typically result in communication disruptions or unauthorized access, not directly in system information discovery.",
