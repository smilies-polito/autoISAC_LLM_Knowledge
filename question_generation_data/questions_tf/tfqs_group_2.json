        "question": "In a scenario where researchers utilized a token for lateral movement from the 'IC' device to the 'CID', it is likely that remote service protocols such as Telnet or SSH were involved.",
        "options": {
            "T": "True: Remote service protocols like SSH are typically used for lateral movement.",
            "F": "False: The token used in the scenario suggests a different mechanism not involving remote service protocols."

            "T": "The use of a token to move laterally, as described in the procedure, aligns with the 'Remote Services' technique, which involves using protocols like SSH.",
            "F": "Tokens generally suggest authentication or session management, which can be associated with remote services."

            "T": "True: The use of unsecured credentials involves relaying communication between devices.",
