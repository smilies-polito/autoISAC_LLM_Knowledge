        "Explanation": {
            "T": "This scenario describes the exploitation of UDS to actuate vehicle functions such as brakes, aligning with the technique of abusing UDS for affecting vehicle function.",
            "F": "The scenario does involve UDS abuse, as it uses diagnostic commands to actuate the brakes and lock the accelerator."

        "Explanation": {
            "T": "This would be incorrect as the scenario involves sending diagnostic commands rather than creating a denial-of-service condition.",
            "F": "Correct, because replaying packets to control headlamps aligns with abusing UDS rather than denial-of-service attacks."

            "T": "This action aligns with the technique of reprogramming an ECU to gain control over vehicle functions by exploiting software update mechanisms.",

            "T": "This is incorrect as modifying the OS kernel or system partition involves altering system software, not manipulating network messages.",
