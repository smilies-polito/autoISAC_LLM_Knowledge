        "question": "An adversary attempting to send spoofed Controller Area Network (CAN) messages to a vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to cause unintended vehicle functions, such as activating the brakes through the Pre-Collision System, is utilizing the technique of Unintended Vehicle Network Message.",
        "options": {
            "T": "True, this matches the technique of Unintended Vehicle Network Message which includes sending messages the host is not supposed to send.",
            "F": "False, this scenario does not relate to Unintended Vehicle Network Message, as activating brakes through spoofed messages is covered by a different technique."
        },
        "correct_answer": "T",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "True is correct because the described scenario involves sending unauthorized or wrongly timed messages to vehicle systems, which aligns with the Unintended Vehicle Network Message technique.",
            "F": "False is incorrect because the misuse of CAN messages in the described scenario is a textbook case of the Unintended Vehicle Network Message technique."

        "question": "Using Techstream software and a J2534 pass-thru device to manipulate a vehicle without performing real-world tasks reflects the Abuse UDS for Affecting Vehicle Function technique.",
        "options": {
            "T": "True, using diagnostic tools to control vehicle functions without real-world tasks matches this technique.",
            "F": "False, this activity does not relate to abusing Universal Diagnostic Services and reflects a different technique."
        },
        "correct_answer": "F",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "True is incorrect because the scenario primarily involves manipulating vehicle functions, which falls under the category of diagnostic equipment abuse, not specifically UDS abuse.",
            "F": "False is correct. The scenario involves manipulating vehicle functions through diagnostic equipment, which is a different technique involving aftermarket or dealer equipment."

            "T": "True, bypassing UDS security to generate keys matches the Bypass UDS Security Access technique.",

        },
        "correct_answer": "T",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "True is correct because the described scenario explicitly involves bypassing UDS security mechanisms, which is central to the Bypass UDS Security Access technique.",
            "F": "False is incorrect because the scenario is clearly about bypassing security in UDS, fitting the Bypass UDS Security Access technique."

            "T": "True, replaying CAN packets to affect the engine uses the Abuse UDS technique.",
            "F": "False, this scenario involves Unintended Vehicle Network Message rather than Abuse UDS."
        },
        "correct_answer": "F",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "True is incorrect because the scenario involves replaying CAN packets, which fits the Unintended Vehicle Network Message technique rather than Abuse UDS.",
            "F": "False is correct since the action of replaying CAN packets corresponds to sending unintended vehicle network messages, not directly related to UDS manipulation."

        },
        "correct_answer": "F",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "True is incorrect because while writing CAN packets involves network manipulation, reprogramming ECUs for lateral movement usually involves updating ECU software.",
            "F": "False is correct as the technique of Reprogram ECU for Lateral Movement involves updating or changing the ECU's software, not just sending arbitrary packets."
