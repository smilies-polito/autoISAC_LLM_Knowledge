        "question": "An attacker uses the Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) system's design weakness to spoof GPS signals, causing a vehicle to trust inaccurate location coordinates more than other sources. The in-vehicle system sends unintended messages because of these false coordinates, helping the vehicle to remain in lane safely.",

        "correct_answer": "F",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "This would mean the spoofing attack makes the vehicle stay in lane, which contradicts the procedure of causing lane departure.",
            "F": "The correct interpretation is that spoofing the GPS signals causes the vehicle to miscalculate its position, potentially leading to lane departure, not safe lane keeping."

        "Explanation": {
            "T": "Unintended messages do not specifically relate to diagnostic functions or headlamp control; these actions are related to the abuse of Universal Diagnostic Services (UDS).",
