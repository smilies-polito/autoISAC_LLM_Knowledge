        "question": "Wireless attacks targeting the physical-layer of the Combined Charging System (CCS) are a major threat because they leverage design choices in power-line communication (PLC) that make CCS particularly susceptible to electromagnetic side-channel attacks.",
        "options": {
            "T": "True. PLC design choices in CCS expose it to electromagnetic attacks.",
            "F": "False. CCS is well-protected against electromagnetic side-channel attacks due to its robust PLC design."

        "correct_answer": "T",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "The procedure highlights that the design choices in power-line communication (PLC) within CCS make it susceptible to electromagnetic side-channel attacks.",
            "F": "This is incorrect. The procedure clearly indicates the vulnerability of CCS due to its PLC design."

        "correct_answer": "F",
        "Explanation": {
            "T": "This is incorrect. The effectiveness of BLE location tracking is contingent on certain conditions and characteristics, as noted in the procedure.",

        "question": "Adversaries may use a network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wireless vehicle network connection as part of electromagnetic side-channel attacks.",
        "options": {
            "T": "True. This is part of the network sniffing technique used in side-channel attacks.",

            "T": "Network sniffing involves using a network interface to capture information, as described in the network sniffing technique.",
