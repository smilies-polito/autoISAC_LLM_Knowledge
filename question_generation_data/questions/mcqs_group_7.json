            "A": "Exploit Co-Located Computing Device for Privilege Escalation involves leveraging control over one component to access another within the same ECU.",
            "B": "Rogue Cellular Base Station is correct as it involves using a fake base station to intercept cellular communication.",
            "C": "Network Service Scanning focuses on enumerating services through port and vulnerability scans.",

            "A": "Code signing bypass is not directly related to the in-vehicle browser vulnerability.",
            "B": "Memory corruption leads to forced reboots but is not the method described here for privilege escalation.",
            "C": "NBT Vulnerabilities are correct as these were used to exploit the in-vehicle browser.",
