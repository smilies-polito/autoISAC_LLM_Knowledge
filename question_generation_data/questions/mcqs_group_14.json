        "question": "In the context of extracting security-related secrets from an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), what is the primary goal of an adversary using the ECU Credential Dumping technique?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To retrieve account login and credential material in hash or clear text form",
            "B": "To damage the hardware components of the ECU",
            "C": "To redirect vehicle navigation systems",
            "D": "To enhance the audio system of the vehicle"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "Explanation": {
            "A": "Correct. The ECU Credential Dumping technique is used to obtain login and credential material, which can be in the form of a hash or a clear text password.",
            "B": "Incorrect. This technique does not focus on damaging hardware components.",
            "C": "Incorrect. Redirecting vehicle navigation systems is not a primary goal of this technique.",
            "D": "Incorrect. Enhancing the audio system is unrelated to the ECU Credential Dumping technique."

            "A": "Security-related secrets like keys and passwords",
            "B": "Personal user information",
            "C": "Vehicle speed and engine parameters",

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "Explanation": {
            "A": "Correct. The procedure targets security-related secrets such as keys and passwords, excluding personal user information.",
            "B": "Incorrect. The procedure does not target personal user information.",
            "C": "Incorrect. Vehicle speed and engine parameters are not the focus.",

        "question": "How might the credentials obtained from the ECU Credential Dumping technique be used by adversaries?",
        "options": {
            "A": "To perform lateral movement and access restricted information",
            "B": "To initiate a denial-of-service attack on the ECU",

        "Explanation": {
            "A": "Correct. Credentials obtained can be used for lateral movement and accessing restricted information.",
            "B": "Incorrect. This technique focuses on credential use rather than causing a denial-of-service.",
            "C": "Incorrect. Reprogramming for fuel efficiency is not related to the use of credentials.",
            "D": "Incorrect. Broadcasting unauthorized radio signals is unrelated."
