        "Explanation": {
            "A": "The use of a token to move laterally between devices corresponds to the 'Remote Services' technique, where adversaries log into services designed to accept remote connections.",
            "B": "Unsecured Credentials involves searching for insecurely stored credentials, not using tokens for movement.",
            "C": "Exploit via Removable Media involves malware on removable media, which is unrelated to token movement.",
            "D": "Relay Communications involves making devices appear closer than they are, not lateral movement using tokens."
