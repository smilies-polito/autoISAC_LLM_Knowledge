            "A": "Incorrect. Reflashing firmware is not mentioned in this context.",

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "Explanation": {
            "A": "Incorrect. While damage can occur, permanent engine damage is not directly tied to denial-of-service.",
            "B": "Incorrect. Locking doors is not a direct result of a denial-of-service attack on the CAN network.",
            "C": "Correct. Flooding the bus with high-priority messages can prevent ECU communication.",
