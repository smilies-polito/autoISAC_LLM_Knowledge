We show that design choices in the use of power-line communication (PLC) make the system particularly prone to popular electromagnetic side-channel attacks. We implement the first wireless eavesdropping tool for PLC networks and use it to observe the ISO 15118 network implementation underlying CCS, in a measurement campaign of 54 real charging sessions, using modern electric vehicles and state-of-the-art CCS chargers. We find that the unintentional wireless channel is sufficient to recover messages in the vast majority of cases, with traffic intercepted from an adjacent parking bay showing 91.8% of messages validating their CRC32 checksum.</p><p>By examining the recovered traffic, we further find a host of privacy and security issues in existing charging infrastructure including plaintext MAC-layer traffic recovery, widespread absence of TLS in public locations and leakage of private information, including long-term unique identifiers. Of particular concern, elements of the recovered data are being used to authorise billing in existing charging implementations.</p><p>We discuss the implications of pervasive susceptibility to known electromagnetic eavesdropping techniques, extract lessons learnt for future development and propose specific improvements to mitigate the problems in existing chargers.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-baker.pdf\" title=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-baker.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a></p>",

For example, we send a UDP as follow to open the trunk.“\n\nThey also found that arbitrary CAN messages can be sent to any CAN bus on the vehicle network by misusing a diagnostic function: “We can send any CAN message to any CAN bus channel in the car, thanks to the Gateway leaving an obvious way in diagtask which can be used to inject CAN bus (diagnosis function 0x04) by sending UDP messages to 3500 port on the Gateway“\n\nSome messages were selectively blocked to disable safety interlocks: “we can block some important messages (like the ID of 0x218 on BDY CAN) by changing the target ID in firmware after we locating the structure stored in the firmware to open the trunk or disable the auto lock function when car is in very high speed.

During our talk, we'll examine the details of three different classes of vulnerabilities we found in this vehicle, how they can be exploited, and the potential ramifications to the owner of their real-world exploitation. We'll also discuss the broader scope of the vulnerabilities discovered, how they extend beyond just this specific vehicle, and what the industry can do better to prevent these types of problems in the future.</span></p>",
